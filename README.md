# Journey Down
By Jacob Kerr, 2018

 - master_script.py: main script, used as handler for sequence functions (sequences.py) and utility functions (utility.py)

A text-based RPG game made in raw Python
You start out at the mouth of a cave without your memory. You must travel farther into the caverns to find artifacts and scraps of writing that will gradually reveal your past. However, it will not be specifically stated and be intentionally ambiguous to leave it up to interpretation. Once all the artifacts are found, the game ends.
